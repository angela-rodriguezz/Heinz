A 2D strategy battle game which includes both a dialogue, choice, and battle system. Developed during a 2-day game jam with the theme of "You're the Bad Guy." As the villain in the game, you must generate enough charge in your invention in order to destroy the world.

## Gameplay Mechanics

I aided in the battle system including animations, health, physics, and other core game mechanics. Additionally, I was the sole lead in generating the dialogue system and implementing the voice lines within the game which carries three possible endings.

I playtested the gameplay mechanics, noting when there were inaccuracies with the physics and weighing the difficulty of the game. I also completed various technical design tasks throughout the project, including developing the first demo of the gaming which included the throwing mechanics of the enemy AI behaviors, the change between charge and defensive mode, and the health/charge levels of the gameplay.
