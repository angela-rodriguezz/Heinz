A 2D strategy battle game which includes both a dialogue, choice, and battle system. Developed during a 2-day game jam with the theme of "You're the Bad Guy." As the villain in the game, you must generate enough charge in your invention in order to destroy the world. I aided in the battle system including animations, health, physics, and other core game mechanics. Additionally, I was the sole lead in generating the dialogue system carrying three possible endings.
